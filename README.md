# ðŸ“Œ Weather-Data-Storage-System
Weather Data Storage System is a software solution that stores and manages temperature records city-wise and year-wise using 2D arrays and ADTs. It supports insert, delete, and retrieve operations, provides both row-major and column-major access, handles sparse data, and includes time and space complexity analysis.

# âœ¨ Key Features:

- Weather Record ADT â€“ Defines attributes (date, city, temperature) and operations (insert, delete, retrieve).
- 2D Array Storage â€“ Organizes data year-wise (rows) and city-wise (columns).
- Row-major & Column-major Access â€“ Demonstrates two ways of traversing and retrieving tabular data.
- Sparse Data Handling â€“ Uses sentinel values (e.g., -999) or dictionaries to represent missing data.
- Complexity Analysis â€“ Evaluates time and space efficiency of different operations.

# ðŸŽ¯ Purpose:

The system is a real-world application of data structures that helps students understand how to manage large datasets, compare different memory access patterns, and optimize storage when data is incomplete.
